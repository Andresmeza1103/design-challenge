# Design Challenge

Can you do both design AND code? If so, read on...

## Introduction

We're looking for a _Designer Who Can Code_ or a _Developer Who Can Design_ to help us **style** the many new layouts and features that we're building for Hollowverse.

Our tech stack is React, Next.js and TypeScript.

You can use any styling library or styling solution. Just add it, configure it, and use it.

If you're hired, you will only be responsible for the design, mark-up, and CSS. Another developer will take care of things like API calls, data wiring, complex logic, navigation, validation, etc.

Here's how we would work together:

1. You would be given a git branch with a new page or a component that needs styling
1. Before you start working on it, you'd open a pull request
1. You'd start styling and pushing commits to the pull request
1. We'd iterate over the pull request until we are satisfied
1. We'd merge the code and deploy it to the live site
1. We'd go back to step 1

## The Numbers

Hollowverse is growing and is run by an ex-Silicon Valley engineer. It is a public facing website with open source code, so it would look great on a resume or a portfolio. The opportunity for professional and financial growth here is very exciting!

Initially, we're paying $1,000-$2,000 per month, depending on experience.

We will not be tracking how many or how little hours you'll be working. We don't have deadlines or a timeline. We just expect satisfactory and consistent daily output, which would be visible through your git commits.

If you're interested, complete the challenge below.

## The Challenge

In this challenge you'll style the homepage of a website.

The code is done in React, Next.js, TypeScript.

This challenge is hosted on a GitHub template. The first step is for you to create a repository under your account from this GitHub template.

Then

1. `git clone` your repository (which is based on this template)
1. Run `npm i` to install dependencies
1. Run `npm run dev` to start the Next.js development server

The website should now be reachable at `http://localhost:3000` and you are now able to begin styling.

Your job is to style the homepage, which is visible at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Style requirements

Here are some details about the style that we expect from you.

Think of this task as **mobile design**. _Not web design_. 80% of our users are on mobile phones.

**Do not use any responsive breakpoints**. Media-query responsive breakpoints create an unnecessary maintenance overhead for our type of project. We want a single design that stretches and contracts according to the width of the viewport.

The website should look awesome on a mobile screen first. And on a desktop screen second.

We like the mobile sites of [MasterClass.com](https://www.masterclass.com/) and [Netflix.com](https://www.netflix.com/). But we do not want white text on a black background because we think that makes the reading experience less legible for the average user. Hollowverse visitors have to do a lot more reading than visitors of MasterClass or Netflix.

But we like MasterClass and Netflix because their designs feel _human-centric_. Hollowverse should also have a design that is _human-centric_ because it is about the politics, religions, and ideas of celebrities.

### Submitting your design

Once you've finished your design, reach back out to us with a link to your repository. We'll download it, run it, and evaluate your work. You'll be evaluated on metrics such as your artistic style and the cleanliness of your code.

After we're done with our evaluation, we'll get back to you with the decision.

Good luck!
